            <p class="poem">From childhood's hour I have not been
                As others were -- I have not seen
                As others saw -- I could not bring
                My passions from a common spring --
                From the same source I have not taken
                My sorrow -- I could not awaken
                My heart to joy at the same tone --
                And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --
                Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn
                Of a most stormy life -- was drawn
                From ev'ry depth of good and ill
                The mystery which binds me still --
                From the torrent, or the fountain --
                From the red cliff of the mountain --
                From the sun that 'round me roll'd
                In its autumn tint of gold --
                From the lightning in the sky
                As it pass'd me flying by --
                From the thunder, and the storm --
                And the cloud that took the form
                (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
                Of a demon in my view --</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Annabel Lee</h2>
            <p class="poem">It was many and many a year ago,
                In a kingdom by the sea,
             That a maiden there lived whom you may know
                By the name of ANNABEL LEE;--
             And this maiden she lived with no other thought
                Than to love and be loved by me.
             She was a child and I was a child,
                In this kingdom by the sea,
             But we loved with a love that was more than love--
                I and my Annabel Lee--
             With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
                Coveted her and me.
             
             And this was the reason that, long ago,
                In this kingdom by the sea,
             A wind blew out of a cloud by night
                Chilling my Annabel Lee;
             So that her high-born kinsman came
                And bore her away from me,
             To shut her up in a sepulchre
                In this kingdom by the sea.
             
             The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
                Went envying her and me:--
             Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,
                In this kingdom by the sea)
             That the wind came out of a cloud, chilling
                And killing my Annabel Lee.
             
             But our love it was stronger by far than the love
                Of those who were older than we--
                Of many far wiser than we-
             And neither the angels in Heaven above,
                Nor the demons down under the sea,
             Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
                Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:--
             
             For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
                Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
             And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
                Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
             And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
             Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
                In her sepulchre there by the sea--
                In her tomb by the side of the sea.

            <h2 class="h2">The City in the Sea</h2>
            <p class="poem">Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
                In a strange city lying alone
                Far down within the dim West,
                Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
                Have gone to their eternal rest.
                There shrines and palaces and towers
                (Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)
                Resemble nothing that is ours.
                Around, by lifting winds forgot,
                Resignedly beneath the sky
                The melancholy waters lie.
                No rays from the holy heaven come down
                On the long night-time of that town;
                But light from out the lurid sea
                Streams up the turrets silently-
                Gleams up the pinnacles far and free-
                Up domes- up spires- up kingly halls-
                Up fanes- up Babylon-like walls-
                Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
                Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers-
                Up many and many a marvellous shrine
                Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
                The viol, the violet, and the vine.
                Resignedly beneath the sky
                The melancholy waters lie.
                So blend the turrets and shadows there
                That all seem pendulous in air,
                While from a proud tower in the town
                Death looks gigantically down.
                
                There open fanes and gaping graves
                Yawn level with the luminous waves;
                But not the riches there that lie
                In each idol's diamond eye-
                Not the gaily-jewelled dead
                Tempt the waters from their bed;
                For no ripples curl, alas!
                Along that wilderness of glass-
                No swellings tell that winds may be
                Upon some far-off happier sea-
                No heavings hint that winds have been
                On seas less hideously serene.
                
                But lo, a stir is in the air!
                The wave- there is a movement there!
                As if the towers had thrust aside,
                In slightly sinking, the dull tide-
                As if their tops had feebly given
                A void within the filmy Heaven.
                The waves have now a redder glow-
                The hours are breathing faint and low-
                And when, amid no earthly moans,
                Down, down that town shall settle hence,
                Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
                Shall do it reverence.

            <h2 class="h2">Dream-Land</h2>
            <p class="poem">  By a route obscure and lonely,
                Haunted by ill angels only,
                Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
                On a black throne reigns upright,
                I have reached these lands but newly
                From an ultimate dim Thule --
                From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
                      Out of SPACE -- out of TIME.
            
                Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
                And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
                With forms that no man can discover
                For the dews that drip all over;
                Mountains toppling evermore
                Into seas without a shore;
                Seas that restlessly aspire,
                Surging, unto skies of fire;
                Lakes that endlessly outspread
                Their lone waters -- lone and dead, --
                Their still waters -- still and chilly
                With the snows of the lolling lily.
            
                By the lakes that thus outspread
                Their lone waters, lone and dead, --
                Their sad waters, sad and chilly
                With the snows of the lolling lily, --
                By the mountains -- near the river
                Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever, --
                By the grey woods, -- by the swamp
                Where the toad and the newt encamp, --
                By the dismal tarns and pools
                        Where dwell the Ghouls, --
                By each spot the most unholy --
                In each nook most melancholy, --
                There the traveller meets aghast
                Sheeted Memories of the Past --
                Shrouded forms that start and sigh
                As they pass the wanderer by --
                White-robed forms of friends long given,
                In agony, to the Earth -- and Heaven.
            
                For the heart whose woes are legion
                'Tis a peaceful, soothing region --
                For the spirit that walks in shadow
                'Tis -- oh 'tis an Eldorado!
                But the traveller, travelling through it,
                May not -- dare not openly view it;
                Never its mysteries are exposed
                To the weak human eye unclosed;
                So wills its King, who hath forbid
                The uplifting of the fringed lid;
                And thus the sad Soul that here passes
                Beholds it but through darkened glasses.
            
                By a route obscure and lonely,
                Haunted by ill angels only,
                Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
                On a black throne reigns upright,
                I have wandered home but newly
                From this ultimate dim Thule.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Lenore</h2>
            <p class="poem">Ah, broken is the golden bowl! — the spirit flown forever!
                Let the bell toll! — a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river: —
                And, Guy De Vere, hast thou no tear? — weep now or never more!
                See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
                Come, let the burial rite be read — the funeral song be sung! —
                An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young —
                A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.
                 
                "Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and ye hated her for her pride;
                And, when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her — that she died: —
                How shall the ritual, then, be read? — the requiem how be sung
                By you — by yours, the evil eye — by yours the slanderous tongue
                That did to death the innocence that died and died so young?"
                 
                Peccavimus; yet rave not thus! but let a Sabbath song
                Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!
                The sweet Lenore "hath gone before," with Hope that flew beside,
                Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride —
                For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies,
                The life upon her yellow hair, but not within her eyes —
                The life still there upon her hair — the death upon her eyes.
                 
                "Avaunt! — avaunt! from fiends below the indignant ghost is riven —
                From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven —
                From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven! —
                Let no bell toll, then! — lest her soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
                Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damnéd Earth!
                And I — to-night my heart is light! — no dirge will I upraise,
                But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days!"
