            <h2>Freelance is a job too!</h2>
            <p class="resume">Since 2011, I have discovered a magical world of  freelancing. It all started banally, with simple tasks. Book reviews for online publications. It was interesting, but not always easy. But I like to read, so it was more interesting than difficult.
                <br><br> <span>But it was necessary to grow somewhere.</span>  And the era of copyright began. After a while, I realised that I could write a good text about anything. It was very cool because, in order to write well, you had to understand the topic, that is, always look for new information.
                <br><br> <span>ut it was necessary to grow somewhere.</span> B Then it became more interesting. SMM and SEO! It was a real challenge. Because now you have to know and control even more. Constant monitoring of competitors, latest trends, and audience needs. All this should be known and understood. "Serpstat" helped me in the process of work.

                            Creating something new is a real miracle. Imagine how a piece of metal turns into a perfect knife in your hands. This is an incredible feeling! It is impossible to convey this emotion when you realize that you've mastered the skills of processing different materials and now you can do almost anything. This is one of my hobbies, I would call it a new word "craft".

                            Photography is a very creative process. If you are not working in the studio, there are a lot of little things to consider. Weather, sun, and wind can all ruin a great plan, or help make a really amazing photo.

                            The macro photography was a real discovery for me. This is something incredible! You never know what will be caught in the frame. Very often your eyes just can't see what you are photographing.

                                Life is turbulent. Unfortunately, I had to study and do things that I didn't even know about until 2014. This is sniper camouflage. As part of a small group of initiative people in my city, I was engaged in the production and development of camouflage suits and large camouflage nets. Unfortunately, we have to deal with this even now.
